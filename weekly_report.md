- Got everything setup with the course
- Filled out the course override form for CP494 Directed Research Studies II
- Filled out the consent form

### Week 3 (Date: Sept 14 - Sept 20  )
- Updated Literature Review table with literature review from 4 research papers
- Added all research papers to Zotero
- Thoroughly analyzing each research paper trying to understand the different localization and mapping algorithms such as SLAM and EFK and for different types of machines these algorithms were used on

### Week 4 (Date: Sept 21 - Sept 27  )
- Kept reading research papers more in depth
- Knowledge transfer with Bantu and had some explanation on the general overview of this project and its architecture
- Asked Sherry for more research papers on Path Planning Algorithms

### Week 5 (Date:  Sept 28 - Oct 4 )
- Bantu left for vacation attaching perception model output and perception model ipynb
- I tried connecting the findings in the research papers, trying to understand R2R Dataset given the R2R powerpoint by sherry
- Showcased my robot on Fridays meeting and also how to remote into the robot using rustDesk

### Week 6 (Date: Oct 5 - 11  )
- Started working on the python code implementation on the robot
- Trying to take the perception model  as a python notebook, converting it to a python file and running it in the robot, including downloading datasets on the robot.
- Unfortunately as I was updating the OS to match the dependencies in the python file, using sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade and that ended up crashing the entire OS.
